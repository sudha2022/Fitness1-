# Fitness1- is a repository being created in the Github
Created the FitnessPal project in eclipse
Created the Person class and Fitness as main class
Since the attributes are private in the person class made them public by using CONSTRUCTORS and GETTERS and SETTERS
Used toString() method
The output of the project works on getting the first name of the person and calculating the BMI of each person by creating the objects
